# JAX Automatic Differentiation Implementation

This project implements automatic differentiation from scratch using JAX. It provides a foundational implementation of forward-mode and reverse-mode automatic differentiation.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment using conda:
```
conda create --name jax-grad python=3.10
conda activate jax-grad
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `autodiff.py`: Core implementation of automatic differentiation
- `test_autodiff.py`: Test cases for the implementation
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## Features

- Forward-mode automatic differentiation
- Basic mathematical operations support
- Test suite for verification

## Usage

Basic example:
```python
from autodiff import grad

def f(x):
    return x ** 2

df = grad(f)
result = df(3.0)  # Should return 6.0
```
